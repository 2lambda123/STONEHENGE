**STONEHENGE - Suite for Nonlinear Analysis of Energy Harvesting Systems** is an ensemble of easy to run codes for nonlinear dynamic analysis of energy harvester systems. 

## Software History

This suite is an ensemble of codes developed to conduct nonlinear analysis on a bistable piezoelectric-magneto-elastic energy harvester. 

The underlying results are reported in the following paper:
- *V. G. Lopes, A. Cunha Jr, Bifurcation analysis on a nonlinear bistable energy harvester, 2020*

## Documentation

**STONEHENGE** routines are commented in order to explain their functionality to the final user. Each routine has a short description about its purpose, and a list of inputs and/or outputs.
